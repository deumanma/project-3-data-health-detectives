## Brain Tumor Classification Using Deep Neural Networks

Brain tumor classification is a critical task in medical imaging, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment planning for patients. Deep Learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has shown remarkable success in this area. Here, we explore two effective design strategies for constructing deep neural networks capable of classifying brain tumors into four distinct types.

## Custom CNN Architecture 
### Design Overview
The Custom CNN Architecture is tailored specifically for the dataset at hand, allowing for a flexible design that can be iteratively refined to meet the unique requirements of brain tumor classification.
